# DSA_using_c-\_practice

1- Including Libraries
C++ is a versatile language, and it relies on libraries to access various functionalities. To perform tasks like input and output, we include specific libraries at the beginning of our code. For instance, #include<iostream> is used for input and output operations, while #include<math.h> allows us to use mathematical functions. Simply put, libraries provide pre-built functions and tools for us to use in our code.

2- ENDL vs \n
The reason for this is that \n is a simple escape sequence that inserts a newline character, which is a low-level operation that directly moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line in the output. On the other hand, std::endl not only adds a newline character but also flushes the output buffer. Flushing the buffer can be a more costly operation in terms of performance, especially when youâ€™re printing a large amount of text.


3-PATTERN
  1-Numbers of line in pattern(colums) for first loop.
  2-Row statements for 2nd loop(inner loop).
  3-check Statement i.e=> (space , number , space)like peramid pattern.
